# Project Description
This project is a Vehicle Allocation System developed using FastAPI and MongoDB. It allows employees to allocate vehicles to themselves for a day, ensuring no vehicle is double-booked. Drivers are pre-assigned to vehicles, and allocations can only be created, updated, or deleted before the allocation date. The system also includes a history report feature with filters.
